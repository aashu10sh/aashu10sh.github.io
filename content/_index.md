I'm currently studying Computer Science at the Deerwalk Institute of Technology, Nepal. In my spare time I enjoy working on side projects, contributing to open source, and reading. I'm also a big fan of the Go programming language. On this blog I write about projects I'm working on as well as general topics I'm interested in:)
