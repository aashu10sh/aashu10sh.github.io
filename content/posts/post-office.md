# Prologue
I learned about ol man Bukowski when I came across a video titled `"Bluebird by Charles Bukowski"`. It had the picture of Adrien Brody looking all melancholic in the thumbnail, I thought 'what the hell' and gave it a shot. "where was this all my life" I asked myself after the poem. The poem was incredible, It was so simple to digest yet it had many layers that challenged many dark themes in our lives. I looked up more stuff on Old Man Bukowski.

# Discovery
Man I listened ( i am a bum, i look at videos that recite his poems:D instead of reading them ) so many bukowski poems after that. Each so different than the last and yet equally as dark and crude. The poem 'Hell is a Lonely Place' still gives me goosebumps. I think I showed off my new found Bukowski poems to all my close friends. Some understood, some called me strange. I looked at some of his interviews next, The one where he talks about his first woman stood out the most to me. I was perplexed, here is an ugly old man drinking booze, shouting profanity and bragging about a terrible thing he did. Most would cower, hide and prefer not to talk about such things but not bukowski, old man was as naked as a new born child. Telling it just the way it was no spices, not biasness, noting, just experience and reflection. I liked that. Next time I went to Books Mandala I bought myself the Post Office, I wanted to read his best work and apparently this was it.

# Part 1
> Before I move on to the review, the introduction to the book by Niall Griffiths is bloody brilliant. Bukowski would approve

In the first part of the book we are introduced to the drunken, dirty and womanizing Henry Chinaski as he lands a job as a substitute mailman in the post office. We're also introduced to Betty, his girlfriend at the time. In this part of the book we learn about the life at the post office, Henry is fairly young here, He's always cheating on Betty, getting drunk and rebelling against his boss. He's immature, impulsive, rude and violent at times. He's always gambling his money away at the tracks.
