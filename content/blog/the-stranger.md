<!-- # Thoughts -->

I was really looking forward to reading this one (It won the nobel prize in literature in 1957). I was told this was one of Camus' best and boy does it deliver. What I really liked about this book was how simple it was to digest, no fancy words, no confusing sentences, even someone with very basic understanding of english could read this book without too many issues and I think it shows how incredible Camus is as a writer. Simplicity is the greatest complexity after all:)

The books getting going right from the start as we join the main character (**Meursault**). Meursault is in the absolute sense of the word a stranger, he is a very fascinating individual and he really does live up to the title of the book, Meursault is a stranger and not just to the people around him but to himself as well, he has no idea who he is or what he's doing here in fact often times we see that he does not even know what he's feeling. He just exists and does what he thinks needs to be done, his actions do not seem to be guided but human emotions or deep values that he has for himself but by societal laws. This is very evident when he goes to his mothers funeral, he did not go there because he felt remorse, he went there because society says "when your mother dies you go to the funeral"

He's very conflicted about things in life specially things around love and relationships, he seems to only look at things objectively however we do see glimpses of him showing emotions specially around Marie, this duality of Meursault where he shows no remorse for killing the Arab and no conventional grief at his mother's death makes him an outcast or dare I say a "Stranger" and for society to accept and that is why he is hanged in the end ( oops, spoilers ).

I truly believe that Meursault killed the arab out of self defense but his crime was not killing the arab but rather being himself which he is guilty of by showing no remorse at the death of the arab and his mother. Such is the fate of the strongest of the strange.

Here's a cool Bukowski poem that totally fits the context.

```
you won’t see them often

for wherever the crowd is

they

are not.

those odd ones, not

many

but from them

come

the few

good paintings

the few

good symphonies

the few

good books

and other

works.

and from the

best of the

strange ones

perhaps

nothing.

they are

their own

paintings

their own

books

their own

music

their own

work.

sometimes I think

I see

them– say

a certain old

man

sitting on a

certain bench

in a certain

way

or

a quick face

going the other

way

in a passing

automobile

or

there’s a certain motion

of the hands

of a bag—boy or a bag—

girl

while packing

supermarket

groceries.

sometimes

it is even somebody

you have been

living with

for some

time—

you will notice

a

lightning quick

glance

never seen

from them

before.

sometimes

you will only note

their

existance

suddenly

in

vivid

recall

some months

some years

after they are

gone.

I remember

such a

one—

he was about

20 years old

drunk at

10 a.m.

staring into

a cracked

New Orleans

mirror

facing dreaming

against the

walls of

the world

where

did I

go?
