I was familiar with Bukowski's poetry however I hadn't held a Bukowski book before, One spontaneous book-haul with close friend Rashihang made it possible. I was told good things about the post office by some friends and it was time to see for myself if the book really was worth the hype.

Bukowski has a very natural way of capturing the attention of a reader with his very real and crude views on life, if offers a refreshingly opposite perspective to the toxic positive mindset that we as a society have adapted. The moment I finished the first chapter I knew that I would finish this book in no time. The post office was un-apologetically raw, unfiltered and naked that I found the book profoundly beautiful, but not in a traditional aesthetic sense rather in a very humane sense, the book did not cower away at presenting the crudeness of human nature and it stood out as an example that maybe we should't cower away from the madness of the mundane but instead embrace it. after all, everyone at some point in their life has felt it. That gut-wrenching feeling that despite of all the progress you will be miserable. It refuses to be a beautiful lie and remains as real as it gets, this can be further demonstrated with our protagonist ( if he can even be called that ) Henry Chinaski who is protrayed as the broken, womanizing, sadistic, sad drunk that he is. Chinaski does not stand out as one of those growth oriented protagonists who go through an arc and return a better person, Chinaski remains the same person he was in the beginning of the book and we simply follow him as a sequence of events happen. One particular event that left me questioning life was what happened with Betty in the book. It scared the living shit out of me how Betty was not so different from a lot of us and how we were a few bad decisions away from sharing the same fate as her. It was a wake up.

If you are looking for a book to motivate you or give you something to feel good about, this aint it. This is the story of a sad old man living a miserable life with no grand catharsis. However I would not discourage you to read this book if anything I want you to read it, You don't have to relate to Henry Chinaski or even like him, His story is that of so many that have come before us and will come after us, the madness of the mundane.

All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. My punishment continues to elude me and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.*s
