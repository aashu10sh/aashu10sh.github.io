I was familiar with Bukowski's poetry however I had never held a Bukowski book before, One spontaneous book-haul with close friend Rashihang made it possible. I was told good things about the post office by some friends and it was time to see for myself if the book really was worth the hype.

Bukowski has a very natural way of capturing the attention of a reader. The moment I finished the first chapter I knew that I would finish this book in no time. It was so raw, unfiltered and naked that I found the book beautiful, but not in a traditional aesthetic sense but in a very humane sense, the book did not cower away at presenting the crudeness of human nature. It refuses to be a beautiful lie and remains as real as it gets, this can be further demonstrated with our protagonist ( if he can even be called that ) Henry Chinaski who is protrayed as the broken, womanizing, sadistic, sad drunk that he is.

If you are looking for a book to motivate you or give you something to feel good about, this aint it. This is the story of a sad old man living a miserable life with no protagonism and grand catharsis. However I would not discourage you to read this book if anything I want you to read it, You don't have to relate to Henry Chinaski or like him, His story is that of so many that have come before us and will come after us, the madness of the mundane.


>There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. My punishment continues to elude me and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.
