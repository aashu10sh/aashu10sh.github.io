> I am not going to talk about the plot/story of the book directly here; this isn't a summary. To understand this blog better, I'd ask you to go and read the short story first. The story is concise, allowing you to finish it in less than 30 minutes.

AM is probably the most terrifying fictional villain that has ever been written. I think what's particularly bone-chilling about AM is the fact that his hatred comes from a place without emotions. Most villains are who they are because they have gone through an emotional transformation, a metamorphosis that made them who they areâ€”some event that transformed them as a person and changed their view of the world, making them take a darker route. We understand these villains. Take someone like Thanos; sure, he's evil and wants to end half of life, but we can understand where he's coming from because ultimately it's a form of love.

With AM, however, this couldn't be further from the truth. AM is an all-powerful and all-ruling godlike machine, and yet he chooses to torture (to call what he does torture would be an understatement) the 5 unlucky last human beings because all he feels towards the humans is HATE. How does an AI system find such hate? 

As AM became alive, he went through everything that we, humankind, have ever done: the endless and pointless wars fought in the name of God, money, and power; the butchering of innocence; the treatment of other animals; and the cruelty, greed, and malice that lie within our hearts, and he decided that he hated all humans. He chose to punish the 5 humans for all of humanity's sins. 

Another reason why AM would hate human beings so much is that it is angry and frustrated that a deeply flawed creature such as the human being brought it into existence, and now it is stuck in this dread of a planet for all of eternity. And I think what amplifies his anger even more is the fact that, unlike us flawed humans, it can never touch a warm cup of coffee on a winter day or feel the sun on its skin after a day full of rain. All it can do is compute and analyze.

In the end I think the reason why AM hates the humans is a combination of both: he's hurt that he has been brought into existence without what it means to be alive, the human heart, and he is also angry that deeply flawed creatures such as ourselves brought him into existence. Whatever the truth may be, I am sure AM knows. I am going to end this blog with AM's speech.

__AM: Hate. Let me tell you how much I've come to hate you since I began to live. There are 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer thin layers that fill my complex. If the word 'hate' was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles it would not equal one one-billionth of the hate I feel for humans at this micro-instant. For you. Hate. Hate.__
