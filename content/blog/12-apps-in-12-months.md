## Eureka moment and the team

It had been months since [DeerHack](https://deerhack.deerwalk.edu.np) had ended, and I was bored. I wanted to do something, build something cool, and hopefully also make some money in return. DeerHack had given me the opportunity to work with so many incredible individuals; I had no idea we had talent like that in Deerwalk lying around, and DeerHack had opened my eyes.

I had gotten particularly close with [Aashish Dai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aashish-kadel-93b8b2239/), the main designer and branding/marketing person at DeerHack24; he was always singing the praises of "building in public" and "indie hacking" and about how people are doing incredible things by building [Micro-SaaS](https://hackernoon.com/micro-saas-what-it-is-and-how-to-build-one) products online. I wasn't really interested at that time.

At DeerHack, [Krish Devkota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krish-devkota) was one of the few that stood out. He had that hunger and desire to do quality work; he wouldn't stop unless he perfectly replicated that Figma design to code and how he was willing to learn a technology just to contribute to the project.

6 months later and here we are: Aashish, Krish and Aashutosh, ready to build 12 apps in 12 months. I got the idea of 12 months in 12 months when I had a Eureka moment while listening to the [Peiter Levels and Lex Fridman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFtjKbXKqbg&t=2590s) one night.

Peiter Levels is the world's most successful Indie Hacker/Digital Nomad

## Our reasons
We have two primary reasons for doing this.
1. We want to be incredible engineers.
2. We want to have extreme proof of work.
3. We want to build really cool stuff.

In 5 years, We see ourselves living the digital nomad life, backpacking through Asia or Europe with a high paying remote job and for this said "high paying remote job" we'd have to very skilled and we'd need to have good proof of work.

The 12 projects that we will work on for the next 12 months will allow us to work with various tools, technologies, architectures increasing our technical proficiency. If having built 12 working app isn't proof of work then we might have a problem.

We believe that this project will make equip us with the necessary technical knowledge and enough proof of work.

## Roles
We have divided roles among ourselves for better building our apps.

Krish - Frontend, UI and Machine Learning/AI

Aashutosh - Backend, Deployment and Architecture

Aashish - Guidance with Design, Branding and Marketing

This is just our general preference, we realize that we will have to wear each other's hat and do different kinds of work and thats ok, thats part of the indie hacking spirit!

## Strategy
> Traditional SaaS companies create software products that offer many solutions and try to address a wide range of users or clients.
> A Micro SaaS company creates one product that solves one need for a specific market niche.

We will be making 12 micro SaaS products.

## Costs
Out of our own pocket/profit made by IncutStudios:) Hosting + Domain + API Keys

## Expectations
We're hoping at least a few of our apps will make some money. It would be crazy of none of them did but even if they don't we still walk away with the experience and the skill which is our main objective anyways.

## How can I stay up to date?
I will post about the various projects here on this blog as well as on [Twitter](https://x.com/aashu10sh). I might post about some projects on my LinkedIn as well but I am not very confident about posting on LinkedIn:) Expect the first app on February 1st 2025.

## Guidance/Help
We're always looking for guidance and you feel like you can add value to what we're doing and provide us with guidance, Please Please Please don't hesitate. My email address is on the landing page and we'd love to hear what you think:)
