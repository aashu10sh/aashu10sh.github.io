This book has its controversies, no doubt but without a shadow of a doubt this is one of the greatest book that I have read. The story of Holden Caulfield hit so close to home. I was Holden Caulfield for a large part of my childhood, I changed 5 schools from Nersery to Grade 6. I found stability after Grade 6 and thank gods I did, It wasn't easy but it all worked out in the end.

There were so many parts in this book where I could relate to how holden felt, not the sexual parts with the prostitute but the parts with "alienation" was something I was super familiar with and maybe thats why I love this book so much. The story of a young adult of trying to hold on to his child self and avoiding adulthood was too real for me. I can see why people around the world love Holden as a character.

I feel like this conversation between Holden and his sister Phoebe really is the heart of this book.


```
I wasn’t listening, though. I was thinking about something else—something crazy.
“You know what I’d like to be?” I said. “You know what I’d like to be?
I mean if I had my goddam choice? . . .
You know that song ‘If a body catch a body comin’ through the rye’?[”]

“It’s ‘If a body meet a body coming through the rye’!” old Phoebe said. 
“It’s a poem. By Robert Burns.” 
She was right, though. It is “If a body meet a body coming through the rye.”
I didn’t know it then, though. . . . “I thought it was ‘If a body catch a body,’” I said.

Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all.

Thousands of little kids, and nobody’s around—nobody big,

I mean—except me. And I’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff
What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff

I mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going 
I have to come out from somewhere and  catch them
That’s all I’d do all day. I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all.[”]
