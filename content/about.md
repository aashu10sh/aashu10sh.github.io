Hey, I'm Aashutosh Pudasaini. I'm interested in:
- Software Engineering (Go, Java, Astro, Python, ...)
- Software Security
- Reverse Engineering
- Backend and System Engineering 
- Game Modding

I'm currenty studying Computer Science at the [Deerwalk Institute of Technology](https://deerwalk.edu.np/DWIT/), Nepal. In my spare time I enjoy working on side projects, contributing to open source, and reading. I'm also a big fan of the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org). On this blog I write about projects I'm working on as well as general topics I'm interested in.
